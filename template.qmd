## Introduction {#sec-intro}

\dropcap{Thanks} for using Quarto to write your article. This Quarto template is unofficial and based on Overleaf's Perspectives on Politics template. Your introduction goes here. Make sure the first paragraph here is at least three lines long, to accommodate the dropped-cap. Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @knuth1984texbook. As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

## Cross Referencing

To reference a figure with example label "plot", use `@fig-plot`. 
Analogously, to reference a table with example label "data", use `@tbl-data`.
To reference a section, such as the Introduction (@sec-intro), use `@sec-intro`.

For complete information on cross referencing with Quarto, see <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html>.

## Tables and Figures

To include figures, you can use Quarto syntax.

![Example figure](sample-fig.eps){#fig-plot}

For both figures and tables, you can use LaTeX syntax if you need additional customizability. 

## Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. For a citation in parentheses use [@greenwade93] and for a text citation: @greenwade93. Multiple citations can be given as [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook]. Drop the author like so [-@greenwade93].
